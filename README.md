# randdbot
Bot which selects string from array, creates image file and tweets (with random string from another array)

Most of the code was learnt from Daniel Schiffman's cool youtube channel and site (schiffman.net) - google it.

This bot does the following:-

1. selects a random image (from library of 10 images)
2. selects a random message (from a txt file)
3. merges the two into a new file
4. selects a suitable status update from another txt file
5. sends a twitter message
6. repeats weekly
